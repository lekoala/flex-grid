A powerful flex based grid system

## How to use

Simply include the library

```html
<script src="flex-grid.js"></script>
```

And use your grid

```html
<flex-grid>
  <div>Col 1</div>
  <div>Col 2</div>
  <div>Col 3</div>
</flex-grid>
```

## Why a custom element ?

The custom element is just a convenience around setting the custom styles

It just makes the whole thing neat. Also, it allows targeting of elements
based on their attributes in css.
